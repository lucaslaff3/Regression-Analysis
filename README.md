## Regression-Analysis
Logistic and Linear Regressions within R to extrapolate necessary predictors for descriptive purposes. 

We had found a marketing campaign file on Kaggle and decided to analyze what type of demographics of customers purchase certain items. This is a rudiementary project, and after obtaining further knowledge, it is possible to do this analysis through clustering, which would be more accurate and specific to the combination of users who buy certain products.
However, this project does well to describe my analytical repetoire. 

Within this repository are 3 files.

## Logisitc-Linear Regression Analysis.R
The working notebook of R code that shows exactly how I manipulated the data, combined with labeled notes and information to describe exactly what each line does. Not all outputs of this file were used within our final project analysis.

## Project Analysis
The powerpoint presentation converted to pdf form to describe, give full context to how we found the information, any adjustments to data and the analysis of our findings. 

## Marketing_campaign.csv
The datafile used to complete the analysis.
